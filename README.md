# Webpack API schema loader

**WARNING** This package is still in development. Should be production-ready soon, but do not rely on this just yet.

This package provides a Webpack loader for loading fully parsed API specs into pages/scripts bundled by Webpack.

Primary use-case for this is inlining OpenAPI/JSON schema definitions into web pages, allowing you tp render them statically by simply importing a YAML/JSON file.
